        The red-headed myzomela (Myzomela erythrocephala) is a bird of the honeyeater family, Meliphagidae. One of two subspecies, M. e. erythrocephala, is distributed around the tropical coastline of Australia; the other, M. e. infuscata, is found mainly around the southern coastline of New Guinea. The species was described by John Gould in 1840. Though widely distributed and not threatened, the species is not abundant within its range. At 12 centimetres (4.7 in), the red-headed myzomela is a small honeyeater with a short tail and relatively long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head, brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts, while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Little has been documented on its breeding behaviour. The bird's natural habitat is tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds
